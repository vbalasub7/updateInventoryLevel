# updateInventoryLevel
updateInventoryLevel


The purpose of the lambda function (zip file found in the same location) is to populate Inventory level for your instance everyday. You can schedule this workflow to run everyday before your SP engine runs to generate the values.

NOTE: This lamdba funtion like others can be scheduled to run at a specific time window with recurring frequency using Amazon Eventbridge service.
